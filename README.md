# predicting-stocks
For this project, we ran several machine learning algorithms on historic S&P 500 data to predict stock prices. In our report,
we outline the pre-processing steps taken and analyze the performance of the various algorithms in predicting the target. Provided
are also the jupyter notebooks used to run the experiments. 
The dataset used is linked in the report.
